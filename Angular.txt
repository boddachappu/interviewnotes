Angular we shold start with version 2 as it is similar to the latest versions.

Angular follows the MVC architectre.

In order to work with Agular we need nodejs to be installed and with that we canm install anglar cli

Once nodejs is instal se below command to install angular cli

npm install -g @angular/cli

Angular has mltiple inbuilt packages like api, forms etc.,

To start new application se below command:
ng new <app name>

To run the application se below command:go to app dir.
np serve --open

once the app is create it will create multiple folders and files in the directory and below are the few important files:
package.json: it will have the dependencies of the project and dev dependencies wjich can used to install using cli.
angular.json:
style.css: if we write any css here it will be applicable to entire project. If we want particlar css to be applied on the component then component css needs to changed.
